# Short description of this project
description: GitHub Action that automatically generates or updates `v<major-release>` tags every time a new release is published.

introduction: |-
  This GitHub Action automatically generates or updates `v<major-release>` tags every time a new release is published, making it effortless to keep track of your project's major versions.

  Imagine your Git repository has the following tags:

  ```
  1.0.0
  1.1.0
  2.0.0
  2.0.1
  2.1.0
  3.0.0
  ```
  
  By simply incorporating Major Release Tagger, your repo will be enriched with the corresponding v-tags:

  ```
  1.0.0
  1.1.0    v1
  2.0.0
  2.0.1    v2
  2.1.0
  3.0.0    v3
  ```

  When you create a new release tagged `3.1.0`, the `v3` tag will automatically point to it:
  
  ```
  1.0.0
  1.1.0    v1
  2.0.0
  2.0.1    v2
  2.1.0
  3.0.0
  3.1.0    v3
  ```

  Stay organized and efficient with Major Release Tagger - the ultimate GitHub Action to streamline your versioning process.
