# Short description of this project
description: Major Release Tagger GitHub Action

introduction: |-
  Creates or re-creates `v<major-release>` tags on new release.

  For example new release gets creates with tag `2.0.0` which corresponds to SHA `1111111111111111111111111111111111111111` then this action will create new tag `v2` which also will point to the same SHA `1111111111111111111111111111111111111111`.

  Then when yet another new release gets created for examlpe with tag `2.1.0` and SHA `2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` then this action will kick in and `re-map` tag `v2` to point to `2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`.
