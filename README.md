## Introduction

This GitHub Action automatically generates or updates `v<major-release>` tags every time a new release is published, making it effortless to keep track of your project's major versions.

Imagine your Git repository has the following tags:

```
1.0.0
1.1.0
2.0.0
2.0.1
2.1.0
3.0.0
```

By simply incorporating Major Release Tagger, your repo will be enriched with the corresponding v-tags:

```
1.0.0
1.1.0    v1
2.0.0
2.0.1    v2
2.1.0
3.0.0    v3
```

When you create a new release tagged `3.1.0`, the `v3` tag will automatically point to it:

```
1.0.0
1.1.0    v1
2.0.0
2.0.1    v2
2.1.0
3.0.0
3.1.0    v3
```

Stay organized and efficient with Major Release Tagger - the ultimate GitHub Action to streamline your versioning process.
