GitHub Action that automatically generates or updates `v<major-release>` tags every time a new release is published.




## Introduction

This GitHub Action automatically generates or updates `v<major-release>` tags every time a new release is published, making it effortless to keep track of your project's major versions.

Imagine your Git repository has the following tags:

```
1.0.0
1.1.0
2.0.0
2.0.1
2.1.0
3.0.0
```

By simply incorporating Major Release Tagger, your repo will be enriched with the corresponding v-tags:

```
1.0.0
1.1.0    v1
2.0.0
2.0.1    v2
2.1.0
3.0.0    v3
```

When you create a new release tagged `3.1.0`, the `v3` tag will automatically point to it:

```
1.0.0
1.1.0    v1
2.0.0
2.0.1    v2
2.1.0
3.0.0
3.1.0    v3
```

Stay organized and efficient with Major Release Tagger - the ultimate GitHub Action to streamline your versioning process.

We use [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) to streamline how Terraform tests are run. It centralizes configuration and wraps common test workflows with easy-to-use commands.

All tests are located in the [`test/`](test) folder.

Under the hood, tests are powered by Terratest together with our internal [Test Helpers](https://github.com/cloudposse/test-helpers) library, providing robust infrastructure validation.

Setup dependencies:
- Install Atmos ([installation guide](https://atmos.tools/install/))
- Install Go [1.24+ or newer](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Install Terraform or OpenTofu

To run tests:

- Run all tests:  
  ```sh
  atmos test run
  ```
- Clean up test artifacts:  
  ```sh
  atmos test clean
  ```
- Explore additional test options:  
  ```sh
  atmos test --help
  ```
The configuration for test commands is centrally managed. To review what's being imported, see the [`atmos.yaml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/atmos/terraform-module.yaml) file.

Learn more about our [automated testing in our documentation](https://docs.cloudposse.com/community/contribute/automated-testing/) or implementing [custom commands](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands/) with atmos.
